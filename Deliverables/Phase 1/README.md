## 1.1 Analysis (Requirements gathering)

### 1.1.1 Use cases

TripNau is a web application similar to airbnb and booking that aims to ease the process of booking properties for
whatever purpose the customer wants, such as vacations, work, etc. Basically, property owners can easily list their
properties on the platform, setting nightly rates for specific time frames and providing detailed information such as
location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities. Then, costumers will be able to scroll
through a list of properties and will have the option to perform bookings for specific time  intervals whenever these are
available. Moreover, the platform facilitates post-stay reviews, allowing users to provide feedback to property owners and
offering insights to potential guests before making a booking.

The following diagram showcases the use cases of the TripNau system.

## 1.2 Design

### 1.2.1 System architecture

#### 1.2.1.1 Class diagram

The TripNau system employs the Domain-Driven Design (DDD) pattern, which emphasizes the encapsulation of domain logic
within distinct aggregates. These aggregates include 'RentalProperty,' 'Review,' 'Booking,' and 'User.' Each aggregate is
represented by a specific color in the following diagram. This architectural approach enhances clarity, organization,
and maintainability within the system by grouping related components together.

#### 1.2.1.2 Components diagram

This section provides a logical representation of the system architecture for TripNau. The following diagram illustrates
how the TripNau system can be divided into various components with a low level of granularity, as well as the interfaces
provided and required by each component.

The diagram below presents an in-depth view of the backend component of the TripNau system, focusing on its various elements
with a higher level of granularity.

**SecurityFilterChain**: Spring Security maintains a filter chain internally where each of the filters has a particular responsibility and filters
are added or removed from the configuration depending on which services are required (**Chain of responsibility pattern**).
Filters can be used for a number of different purposes, like authentication, authorization, exploit protection, and more
[(ref)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/architecture.html).

Security mechanisms must be designed so that a failure will follow the same execution path as disallowing the
operation [(ref)](https://owasp.org/www-community/Fail_securely). A security filter chain is designed in such a way that
downstream filter instances aren't invoked when there is a failure [(ref)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/architecture.html),
adhering to the **Fail Securely Security Principle**.

**HttpAuthorization**: Spring request authorization components permit the definition of match rules by HTTP method
[(ref)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/authorize-http-requests.html).
This adheres to the **Least Privilege Security Principle**.

**InputSanitizer**: Ensures that an input to a system function does not trigger an unexpected and unauthorized behavior.

**InputValidator**: Performs abstract level validations with no domain considerations.

#### 1.2.1.3 Deployment diagram

![](./img/deployment_diagram.png)

Since this is a web application, the client-server architecture was adopted, and in order to relieve the processing load on the
Backend, acting as a gateway, a Middleware component was created that is responsible for filtering out requests that should
not reach the Backend, e.g. requests for authenticate routes that carry invalid tokens. In addition, the Middleware component
is also responsible for sanitizing and validating the payloads of the requests on a technical level, e.g. ensuring that
strings meet the minimum size or that requests with excessively large strings do not reach the Backend.

The Backend, in turn, will be responsible for carrying out all the validation at business level. This component will only
accept requests from Middleware and will therefore ignore all requests from other sources. The database that the Backend
communicates with is hidden from the outside world, being on a private network. This component is also responsible for
communicating with two external APIs in order to fulfill the necessary business flows, in this case the Stripe API and the
Twilio API.

Finally, there is the Logs component, which is included in the entire system, as it is responsible for receiving all the
actions carried out in the system and thus recording everything according to a standard. In order not to block any part of
the system, a message broker was added to the communication, so that actions can be written and read asynchronously.

### 1.2.2 Threat model (Software-Centric approach)

#### 1.2.2.1 Application decomposition

##### 1.2.2.1.1 Threat Model Information

**Application Version**: 1.0

This website is designed for the travel sector, focusing on facilitating the purchase of stays from customer to customer,
emphasizing a peer-to-peer C2C model while excluding commercial entities in this first implementation. The platform supports
three distinct user roles:

- Customer
- Property Owners
- System Admins

Property owners will be able to login and have access to features that allows them to register a new property and view
the booking history for their listings. Users, on the other hand, can browse through a list of available properties without
login, but will be able to login and initiate booking processes, and provide feedback through reviews. System admins will
be able to login and play a role in approving reviews and managing the properties submitted to the platform.

###### 1.2.2.2.2.2 Use and Abuse Case Graphs

The action of logging in as a user is prone to several types of attacks and there are many abuse cases associated with it. In order to mitigate these attacks the application should make sure not to show too much information on login failure as well as lock the account after 3 failure attemps. The amount of time locked out should be incremental as a way to mitigate dictionary attacks. As a way to prevent these attacks, 2FA is also in place.

![Login - Use and Abuse Case Graph](./img/use_and_abuse_case_graph_login.png)

The action of leaving a review can be used by both normal users as a way to show their liking on a booking, but it can also be used by malicious users as a way to influence the ratings on a property, giving it a better rating or worse according to their intents. As a counter-measure to this, the system should validate if users actually stayed in the property to be able to leave a review. Another thing users might do is alter reviews after the first moderation process done by a admin, as a way to leave review that don't follow TOS. For this a review versioning should be in place where whenever a review is altered it can go by an automatic reviewal process and eventually if necessary a manual one.

![Review - Use and Abuse Case Graph](./img/use_and_abuse_case_graph_review.png)

Booking a stay involves the input of a lot of sensitive data from the user including his personal information as well as payment details. This information is usually a target for attackers and needs to be properly secured.
In order to protect it Authentication is required to book stays which includes encryption of the data as well as 2FA, ensuring that, if a user has payment information associated to their account, even if the account login details are compromised, the payment data won't.
When booking a stay the user will perform the payment through the Stripe API, which in itself offers security measures, abstracting the requests with the data from the application, making it harder for bad actors to steal it.
2FA also helps in preventing unauthorized bookings in case a user, for example, leaves his account logged on in an unprotected machine.

![Booking a Stay - Use and Abuse Case Graph](./img/abuse_cases_2.png)

Similarly to booking stays, viewing booked stays can expose sensitive data. The same techniques are applied here.
However, viewing a user's booked stays opens up paths to exploits. 
If a nefarious user has access to an account they might attempt to cancel a booked stay and divert the refunds to an account they control which is why 2FA is once again used as another layer of confirmation before a user is able to cancel their stay.
On the other hand, if a malicious actor manages to gain access to an account with special privileges they might try to cancel another user's stay to try and book their own. Therefore the authentication of moderator/admin accounts has layers of protection to try and ensure their use by authorized personell only.
